# GroupGo: Create Events, Get Together

GroupGo is a web application built with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS that allows users to create events, share them with others, and track locations in real-time.

## Features:

- Event Creation: Organize events with details and descriptions.
- Link Sharing: Invite participants by sharing a unique event link.
- Guest Invites: Invite others to join events using the shared link.
- Google Authentication: Secure login and user management with Google Sign-in.
- Real-time Location Search: Search for and display event locations on a map.

## Getting Started (Development):

### Prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.

> Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Group-go-app.git
```

> Install dependencies

```bash
cd Group-go-app
yarn
```

> Start the development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server at http://localhost:5173 by default. You can now access the application and start working on the codebase.

## Code Structure:

The codebase is organized using a component-based structure with TypeScript for type safety. Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling.
